          A free link in bio page, with nothing held back
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          Most link in bio tools give you a page and then charge for the parts that matter:
          analytics, a clean URL, more than a handful of links. LTReee is free and keeps the useful
          pieces in the free tier. You sign up, pick a username, add links, and share one address.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-2xl font-semibold">What you get for free</h2>
        <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          {INCLUDED.map((item) => (
            <li key={item}>• {item}</li>
          ))}

        <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-2xl font-semibold">How long does setup take?</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          About two minutes. Sign in with Google or email, claim the username you want, paste in
          your links with plain titles, drag them into the order you care about, and publish. Your
          page is live at <code>ltreee.app/yourname</code> immediately and works on every phone.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-2xl font-semibold">No ads on your page</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          Your visitors see your links and nothing else — no banners, no upsell strip, no tracking
          pixels sold to someone else. The page loads fast because there is almost nothing on it
          besides what you put there.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-2xl font-semibold">Where people put their link</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          Instagram and TikTok bios, X and LinkedIn profiles, YouTube descriptions, email
          signatures, résumés, business cards, conference badges. One address, changed in one
