          A link in bio page is a single web page that holds every link you want people to find:
          your website, portfolio, GitHub, LinkedIn, YouTube, shop, résumé and contact details.
          Social platforms usually allow one clickable URL in your profile, so you put your link in
          bio page there and let it do the rest of the work.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-2xl font-semibold">Why people use a links app</h2>
        <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          <li>• One URL works across Instagram, X, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube and email signatures.</li>
          <li>• You change a link once instead of editing every profile you own.</li>
          <li>• Visitors get a fast, mobile-first page instead of a wall of raw URLs.</li>
          <li>• You can see what people actually click and drop what does not work.</li>

          Keep it short. Three to seven links usually outperform twenty. Lead with the one thing you
          want people to open, use plain titles instead of clever ones, and make sure it loads
